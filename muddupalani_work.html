    <h4><p>Which other woman of my kind has<br>
        felicitated scholars with such gifts and money?<br>
        To which other women of my kind have<br>
        epics been dedicated?<br>
        Which other woman of my kind has<br>
        won such acclaim in each of the arts?<br>
        You are incomparable,<br>
        Muddupalani, among your kind.<br>
        
        A face that glows like the full moon,<br>
        skills of conversation, matching the countenance.<br>
        Eyes filled with compassion,<br>
        matching the speech.<br>
        A great spirit of generosity,<br>
        matching the glance.<br>
These are the ornaments<br>
that adorn Palani,<br>
when she is praised by kings.<br>
