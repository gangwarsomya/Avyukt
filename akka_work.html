    <h1> Literary works of Akka Mahadevi</h1>

   <h3> <p>Many mystics have come to Shiva's sacred abode because of the nectar that He is. Akka Mahadevi, a revered saint, is one such mystic. Even as a young child, Akka Mahadevi displayed great devotion to Lord Shiva. She was able to connect with Lord Shiva as Chenna Mallikarjuna, invoking and visualising him as Shiva Linga (a form of Shiva representative of a 'egg' or the primordial, first creation), and even calling upon his presence on her palm, thanks to her Guru's initiatory practise.</p></h3><br>

    <h4><p>“Like a stream flooding the caked bed of a lake,<br>
        like rain pouring on a parched sapling,<br>
        like the pleasures of this world and the fruits of the next <br>coming towards me together today.<br>
        Seeing the feet of my guru, I feel redeemed<br>
        Oh Chennamallikarjuna.”<br>
        
        
        “Look, I wear clothes for the sake of linga,<br>
        I wear jewels for the sake of linga,<br>
        I work for the sake of linga,<br>
        I see for the sake of linga,<br>
        my being within and without, exist for the linga,<br>
        I act without seeming to act.<br>
        One with my Chennamallikarjuna<br>
        what can I say about my being<br>
        just one among many?”<br>
        Legend has it that a Jain king who was enamoured of her beauty, wanted to marry her and<br> pursued her relentlessly. Mahadevi, who was wedded to the consciousness of Shiva, did not accept the king’s proposal.<br>
        “O mother!<br>
        I am in love with the one<br>
        who knows no death, no evil, no form.<br>
        I am in love with the one<br>
        who knows no place, no space, no beginning, no end<br>
        who is fearless and lovely.<br>
        I am in love with the one<br>
        who knows no fears nor the snares of this world<br>
        the Boundless One who knows no bounds.<br>
        More and more I am in love<br>
        with my husband<br>
        known by the name of Chennamallikarjuna.”<br>
        “A gleaming smile; evenly placed pearly teeth;<br>
        tiny brown locks kissing the forehead; a skull garland; and a serpent on the neck.<br>
        He was not golden hued but white colored like a jasmine flower, smeared with white ashes all over his person a form of supreme beauty and purity; a form of supreme dispassion.”
