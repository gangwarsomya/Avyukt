    <p>
        Indian poet Toru Dutt, also known as Tarulatha Dutt, was born in the illustrious Rambagan Dutt family in Bengal province in 1856. Toru came from a family of writers as the eldest child of Govin Chandra Dutt and Kshetramoni Mitter. Her father Govind Chunder Dutt was a linguist who worked for the Indian government and published some poetry. Her mother, Kshetramoni Mitter, was a Bengali translator of The Blood of Christ who had a passion for Hindu mythology. Her father's job with the government required frequent family travel.

    <p>Despite passing away too soon, Toru Dutt is still regarded as one of the greatest Indian-English writers, and her poetry is still held in high regard. Particularly in light of her mixed religious heritage and her early experiences with death, critics have paid close attention to Toru Dutt's lyrics, which emphasise the complexity of personal emotions. Toru Dutt's successful fusion of European and Indian cultural influences has also received a great deal of critical attention. This attention connects her identity as a cosmopolitan and multicultural figure to her poetic synthesis of English verse forms (such as the ballad) with Indian inspirations and legends.
