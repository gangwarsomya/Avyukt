    <h3>(1730-1790)</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>The courtesan Muddupalani once resided in the Thanjavur kingdom. She claimed that modesty was a cloak for the reticent and colourless while fame and wealth came to her.
    </p>
    <p>A patron of the arts and the Maratha heir to vast swaths of Tamil territory, Muddupalani (c.1730-1790) was a gem in the court of Pratapasimha (c.1739-63). But men who cloaked delicate sensibilities in thundering hypocrisy inherited this world a century after their time. Some began referring to Muddupalani as "Muddu Pillai," as if she were a man, as this devadasi poet and her "kind" were no longer respectable and her Telugu epic, the Radhika Santwanamu, promised ignominy and scandal rather than edification through art.
