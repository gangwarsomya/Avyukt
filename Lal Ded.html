    <p>Lal Ded (Mother Lalla), also known as Lalla or Lalleshwari, was a Kashmiri saint and mystic poet who was born in modern-day Kashmir in the 14th century. She was married at the age of 12 into a family who allegedly mistreated her on a regular basis. She gave up her material life and marriage after becoming Sidh Srikanth's disciple in order to devote herself to the god Shiva. She was a mystic who wandered naked, reciting her quatrain-based poetry and proverbs. Lal Ded frequently used poetry as a nonviolent way to interact with both Shaivism and Sufism.

    <p>Numerous people have translated her poetry, including Jane Hirshfield, Coleman Barks, and K.C.I.E. Sir George Grierson for Women in Praise of the Sacred: 43 Centuries of Spiritual Poetry by Women (1994), Naked Song: Lalla (1992), and Lalla-Vakyani or The Wise Sayings of Lal-Ded, A Mystic Poetess of Ancient Kashmir (1920).
