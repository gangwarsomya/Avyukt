    <h1>Literary Works of Lal Ded</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Toru started publishing her work when she was only 18 years old. Her first published works, essays on <em>Henry Derozio</em> and <em>Leconte de Lisle</em>, appeared in Bengal Magazine in 1874, and in this same year, Toru's sister Aru passed away from consumption. The multinational and interracial backgrounds of these poets (Derozio was of Anglo-Portuguese descent and born in India, while Leconte de Lisle was mixed race and born in Mauritius) were of interest to Toru, who herself felt a mix of national influence both as an Indian Christian and during her time abroad. Her first novel <strong><em>Le Journal de Mademoiselle d’Arvers </strong>(The Diary of Mademoiselle D’Arvers) </em>was written in French. She also started to write another novel,  <strong><em>Bianca or The Young Spanish Maiden</em></strong>, which remains incomplete due to her young and untimely death. Both these novels were set outside of India with non-Indian protagonists.
